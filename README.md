# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a python program to create a simple version of the game Tic Tac Toe.
This project utilizes a data path to accept input from the user. This unit
then synthesizes the next move and generates the desired output. It also
makes use of sql connectivity for storing the scores and conditional logic
for knowing whose turn it is and also who the winner is.
